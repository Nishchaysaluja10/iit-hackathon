This system is an Agentic Auditing Pipeline leveraging the Pathway framework to resolve global narrative inconsistency in 100k-word novels. Shifting from probabilistic generation to structured logical auditing, the engine indexes massive contexts in real-time to preserve narrative coherence.

The architecture decomposes complex backstories into atomic claims, utilizing targeted hybrid retrieval and causal reasoning to verify if a hypothesized past logically aligns with established story constraints. By automating verbatim evidence extraction, the system transforms long-context narrative verification into a rigorous classification problem, ensuring that character arcs and causal pathways remain globally consistent
